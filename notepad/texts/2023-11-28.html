			As I mentioned yesterday, I want to write something that has no lesson and meaningless. So I will write about something I liked. It won't be about me. it will be only about the thing that I liked. I'm not gonna even describe why I liked it. any way, today's topic is games. It's too wide so I'm gonna narrow down. firstly, I'm gonna write about the game "cuphead".

			"Cuphead" is a single player run and gun action game (I searched up the genre, i didn't even know that kind of genre existed). so it is basically the game that player control a main character and beat the boss or clear the map. In this game the main character is Cuphead or Mugman. as you can guess, their head is cup and mug. anyway, the game is known as very classic and difficult game. I just searched when did this game came out, and it says it came out at 2017. that means it's not that classic. may be I misunderstood the classic game means. the game is really famous for its graphic because its graphic is based on old classic animation such as micky mouse. so on every screen, it has paper-like background and noizes just like old television. also its theme song is also well made. this tone of design worked really well and everyone liked it. that must be one reason that the Cuphead show animation came out on Netflix. It became a great example that vintage style game works well to people. However unlike its people-friendly design, its difficulty is also famous. therefore many people who is not a gamer tried the game, and failed to complete. I believe that is most of the overall-explanation about the game "Cuphead".

			Let's talk about its story. Games are built to make players to feel amusement. And to provide amusement, game must contain some elements that satisfys players expectation. for example, players have expectations such as "if I hit a bullet to enemy, it will die". And role of game developer is to make a program that satysfys those expectation. if the game satisfys all the expectations as possible. However, you might think players expectations are limitless. for example some player might expect "if I shoot this teapot, he will die". it is realistic so user can expect those to the game. Here is the role of story came out. some background story of game provides some limit to player's expectation. So the story nudge people to expect as developer wanted, and it makes the game more perfect. as you know games that have weak story cannot make player to focus on the game and that is important point of game.

			I have so much thing to talk about the purpose of the game so I might talk about it later. let's talk about Cuphead's story finally. It's about two boy who are called Cuphead and Mugman was hanging out at the town and they went to the sussy house. there was a devil and they played dices. they lost to the devil so they had to give the soul to the devil. instead of giving the soul to the devil, the devil offered bring other debtor's soul who ran away from devil. therefore, Cuphead and Mugman went to the Teapot grandpa. they told him about it and teapot grandpa give them super power that can shoot magic bullet from their finger. Therefore, they go to fight with debtors with the super power (this is the part that player plays). As the game goes on, the teapot grandpa told them "you are stronger than I think, you might fight against the devil and win". after they collect all the soul of debtor of devil, they fight with devil and win.  That's the story. and the story is presented as fairy tale book. so it give more design insight to people.

			it is the first game I bought from the steam and I'm strongly sure It was worth it. it is one of my favorite game and I would recommand it to everyone. Normally I write by following my thoughts, but this time, I tried too much to remove my thoughts so it was very hard to write it. I'm pretty sure this article has no point and consistancy. I don't even know what did I write. anyway, I wrote something and that's great! bye.		</p>
