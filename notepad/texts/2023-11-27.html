			3-years hill
			In korea, there is a funny folktale titled 3-year hill. here is the short summary of the folktale.
			once apon a time, there was a hill that has some superstition. if someone fall over at that hill, the person only can live 3 years. everyone who fell down at that hill, died 3 years after the day he felled down. So everyone in the town always walked carefully when they passes the hill. one day, an old man was passing the hill and he fall down because of a small rabbit. he came back to his house and told it to his family. than everyone of his family started to cry because they knew he will die after 3 years. since that day, the old man spend whole time for worrying about his death. when almost 3 year passed, the old man got sick very badly.  one day, his grandson asked why is he sick so badly. then the old man answered him. then the grandson told him " Then, if you fell over again, you can live 3 years more ". after the old man heard that saying, he ran out to the hill and started to roll at the hill. when he rolled once, he wan't sick anymore, he knew it worked and he rolled 10 times so he could live 30 years more.

			that's the story. I know it's wierd. according to wikipidea, it shows how human overcome the superstition with creative solution. but we all know that's bs. folktale don't have any meaning or goal. they just exist because they are funny and easy to remember. in my personal point of view, it is just hilarious. firstly, the logic doesn't even make sense. if you can live 30 years more if you roll 10 times, that make no sense.  that means the operator of that hill is addition. so when he fell over for the first time, remaining life time must be something + 3 years. unless he was about to die before the biginning of the story. so that's the first part that the story is hillarious. and secondly, on the book, there is a image that an old man is rolling on the hill while laughing. I believe the author (I'm not sure who made this. must be changed over time) but meant this. he/she set the main character an old man even though it might make the story more loose. because some people might think dying old man is not that a terrible thing (this sounds weird). however, the author meant that rolling old man is really funny and it really is. it is kind of too much out of topic but I believe that folktales is original version of meme in terms of evolution theory. the word "meme" was created by Richard Dawkins in his book "selfish gene" to explain only funny meme survives on the internet just like only helpful for reproduction survives on the earth. anyway, forget about it. it's too out of topic.

			The reason I mentioned this folktale is because this kind of thinking process can be applied to other things. In korea, there is a saying that is called "Jak-Sim-Sam-il (작심삼일)" which means your promise to yourself will be broken in 3 days. for example, someone try to loose weight, and he/she fails  within 3 days, we use this saying. so it mostly use when someone make new-years goal something like that. we can approach to the situation simillarly with 3-years hill. even the plan ended in 3 days, we can focus on the fact that he did work hard for 3 days. what if he makes the goal again and again everytime he fails. that 3 days will be 6 days, 9 days, 12 days and so on. so this gives you the lesson. Just start your plan and make promise to yourself. if you fail, do it again. it will leave something and it would be very useful for your future.

			I really didn't wanted to write such lessons on my article but I failed. I don't know why this happend but I think I have some compulsion to conclude my text with something useful. I don't know how to fix it but I'll just write whatever i can. the text will be very messy and don't even get what am I talking about but it will be better some day. great! see you then^^		</p>
