			Let's talk about something interesting. For example, enjoyment. I have some things to talk about enjoyment. Firstly, why people feel enjoyment, fun, and amusement? Let's start our thinking from the fundamental origin. As the feeling existed since before the human so we should find out how did it created by narture. In most case, we need to think about the evolution theory. evolution theory explains that every feature of creature remains still because they helped reproduction of the spieces. How enjoyment helped them to survive and reproduce? I don't know well about hormones but this must be connected with it. Firstly, human will produce hormones such as Dopamin and Adrenaline when they are in danger, to activate muscles and brain more. It is not efficient to fully use them always so that kind of system must help them to survive. Also, when they survived after the danger, it will feel some positive feelings because they overcome a danger and survived. So I believe the status that such hormones exist in their body make them to feel some positive emotion. (don't trust me I know nothing about human body). My dad also talked about something similar. The enjoyment is the middle point of danger and safty. for example, people feel enjoyment when they ride rollercoster because its speed are danger but your brain knows it's safe. there for you can kind of trick your body and feel the enjoyment. Imagine if you are riding a rollercoster but the safty bar is broken. then the whole ride will be just horror. so I believe that enjoyment came from the contradiction that body feels danger but your brain doesn't.

			Also, the opposite case also work. when your brain think it's in danger but your body is safe, you also feel some amusement. Games and Videos are the main cases. Games are little bit more complex so let's start with the videos, which is just a movie. It depends on the genre, but most movie have some problem. And people always identify themselfs with the character in the movie. Therefore, it makes your brain to feel you are in danger. However, how is your body. it cannot be as safe as your body when you watch movie or video. it creates some conflict between your body and brain and it makes some enjoyment. It has some exception because if the video or moive is not well-made enough, then people will not feel sympathy to character in the movie. which means it is trash movie. People think documentaries are not as fun as movies because most documentaries has purpose of sharing information so people don't feel sympathy to the character.

			What about game? It is almost same with the video but It is much easier to feel the sympathy to the main character. because it is much more easier to feel sympathy with the main character of the game than movie or book. Because it acts as you want. if you want to move forward, the main character does. As I mentioned few days ago, the main character of movie act as user's expectation. just like reality. in reality, they move their body in their mind and the body actually moves as they tought. which means they can control the body. And game also enables that. Therefore, people feel sympathy much easily. So That's why people enjoy game more than movie and book. And in most of game have dangers such as zombies, enemies, monsters. those dangers and safeness of your body make conflict and that makes something, which is enjoyment.
