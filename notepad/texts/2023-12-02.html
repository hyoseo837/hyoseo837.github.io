			Today I'm going to talk about money. I like this topic because it is one of the topic that I tought about it the most. There are a lot of weird thing happens with money so there are so many oppertunity to think about it. Also, I take economics course so I can also think about it deeply with kind of professional level of knowledge. anyway, let's start with the origin of the money.

			money was invented by human. Textbook says money was invented to be a measurement of value of product, media of transaction and tool to hold the value someone earned pastly. let's talk about it one by one. Firstly, money is used as measurement of value of product, which is goods and survice, and anything. For example there are two objects. one is a fish, and the other is apple. if they want to exchange it, they wish that they want to exchange equal amount of value. because if someone gives 1 unit of value and get 0.5 unit of value, than they won't want to exchange those goods. in this context, money is used as a measure of the goods. so when we know the price of each product, it will be really useful to reference it. that is one role of money. Second role is media of transaction. it is the most well known role of money, which is money is invented to make transaction more easier. if you have a fish and want apple, then you need to find someone who want fish and have apple. it is almost impossible because nobody knows what who wants what and who have what. if there is money, people can easily exchange their goods to money and exchange it to goods that they want. Last role is the tool to hold the value. actually, I don't remember the exact word choice from the text book so there must be the better word choice. anyway, if there is no money, people must hold there goods until they exchange with something else. For example, you have a fish in your hand, but you don't need any thing for now. but he know he can exchange the fish with something else if he needs something later. What he can do is just waiting. but the point is that the value, of a fish changes over time. it get rotten, and it became less freshier. even he paid a lot of his labour, the value of the result of his hard work diminishes. However, it is different if there is money. he can save his values by exchange it to money, and the value of money doesn't change on time. keeping 1 dollar in your pocket for 10 hours doesn't make it  50 cents. so to save the value is the last role of money.

			We become what we behold. We shape our tools and then our tools shape us. - Marshall McLuhan -

			This quote is one of my best quote in my life. because I agree and I can even feel it that it is true. And also it directly connect to my key perspective. it told us that as much as we shape our tools, our tools shape use too. What I understood from this quote is that we need to be careful not to become a slave of our tools. we should always remind that we made tools to achieve some fundamental problem So that purpose must be prioitized. yes, as you noticed, this connects with the fundamentality, which I mentioned lastly. I beleive the most common case that our tool govern us is the money. as I mentioned above, Human invented money to produce more values and share them. However, these days, there are so many people whose goal of life is to make a lot of money. I believe that the gool of life must be something basic but important. money is just a tool that human made so it cannot be the goal of life. tools always have to remain as a tool in perspective of life. However there are people who think money is everything, and that shows the quote a lot. When I see people like that, I think of this quote. and this happens pretty often. not only money, sometime game, education, politics, and so on. That's why I love to discover the fundamental purpose of any concept and I try to not lost them. I have so much thing to talk about money and my second philosophy in my mind. may be I will talk about it tomorrow.
