			the thing that I'm going to talk about is something that connects with some utilitarianism and some economics but I don't know my thought and them are exactly same so I won't say that I'm talking about those concepts. firstly, my idea is based on the assumption which is every human being always make the best choice. And I strongly believe that is true. people regret and make bad choices because situation changes. let me explain about that. There are certain steps when people make choices. firstly, they notice the context and options they can choose. Secondly, they judge and compare each options theyself in every possible perspective. Lastly, choose the option that has the most value and the least cost. The point of this process is that people judge in all possible perspective even though some of them are ridiculous or not objective. for example it also include some persepective of their daily feeling. That sometimes make them wrong decision, and that makes them regret. Also, there exist some incomplete explanation of situation. Those factors make people to make some non-reasonable choices. Therefore, we can say that every human being always make the best option in that instant of time.

			So when I regret or I think I don't think I did well, I say  "there were no other choice, you made the best choice"  to myself. I believe that the universe is fixed and we don't have the free will. this directly connect with the explanation like above. Actually that's it. I'm sure that my explanation is not perfect, but I don't feel like writing more about it. I don't know why but I will talk about it later again.

			I know today's article really short and shit, but I'm not gonna delete them or fix them. it is impossible to make only good text. If i delete articles because they are bad, that will make me feel some pressure. even they are bad, they are needed because if there is no baddly written text, it also means good texts are not good. becasue they are good text because they are better compare to some other articles. I know this make no sence but I really dont' feel like writing. great bye		</p>
