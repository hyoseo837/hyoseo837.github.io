			Why everyone need to write.
		</p>

		<p>
			Many weeks ago, I have read an article written by some random programmer (must be indian) titled "Everyone need to write". it was very impressive that how he reasoned this idea in different ways. I almost forgot the content of the article, but I can remember some of them. First reason is that knowing how others think is pretty fun. everyone have different thoughts, reasoning and context of thought and most of them are very reasonable. that enables others to think in different ways and sometimes those random articles makes me think something fun. that was his first reason for why everyone should write. it was intro in his article and it was kinda joke. but it is true. writing makes you think more deeper and describe the idea about what you are writing. therefore, reading them also make them interesting.

			Second reasoning is the main point that he is trying to say in that article. (not sure because I don't remember what comes next) it was that if you have writing habbits, it makes you change how you think in your life. and it makes you to be more philosophical and smart. I'm not sure those words best describe what i'm trying to say but it does effect your life possitively. I know that works and I agree with what he is trying to say. I had taken logical writing class when I was in elementry school. It sounds very academic and difficult but actually it was just a class that gives you a random topic to think of and write a short text about it. it's been like 7 years  but there are several topics that I can still remember. any way, I'm pretty sure that it is the class that changed my lifestlye the most. it always give me new viewpoint and makes me think how to express that thought process precisely so others can understand. and the change of my life was very possitive. as I mentioned, I was very young , so I couldn't compare the change relatively, but I'm sure that my insight have improved alot trough that course. What i'm trying to say through this expirience is to say how writing habbits and thinking deeply on one topic can change your life.

			Then, lets think about the conclusion. WHY I DON'T WRITE? I know the importance of writing and I know how good it is. I'm pretty sure that it is because I'm freaking lazy and lack of will to become better person. this is true and I hate this. I'm afraid of saying "I'm going to start this marathon again and I will write something everyday" because I did this 2 times. And failed. However, I know what to do to make me a better person. I'm not going to pressure me and make a promiss about it.

			I think that's it for today. actually I don't want to write something about me. I tried it but sometimes it makes me to see my darkside more. I want to write about other things and my short idea about it. such as old folk tales, bibles, philosophy, or technology. doesn't matter, everything except me. Whatever, great! bye		</p>
