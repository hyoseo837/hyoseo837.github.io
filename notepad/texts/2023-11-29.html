			Fundamentality? I dont' even know such word exist. whatever, I'm going to talk about it. when I think about something, I prefer to approach to the concept from the fundamental purpose. for example, when I talk about game, it's fundamental purpose is to amuse people. The fundamental purpose is a very useful viewpoint to determine where did it came from. So it enables us to find out why it was invented/discovered/created and then how the main purpose has changed can be determined. the example that I love to talk about when I explain something about fundamentality is the traffic light. Once, some thought came into my mind, which is "Is it needed to follow the traffic light even if you know there are no passenger?". here is more detailed explanation about the situation. you are driving in a town. it is late night so nobody are walking around the town. so you are just driving alone and you can notice that there are nobody who are taking a walk or something else. and there is a crossroad with traffic light. It is red right now, but you know and there are nobody walking and driving. there are no camera or something so nobody will know even you just ignore the traffic sign. the camera really doesn't matter to the context but there might some people who will stop at the traffic light because of the law. any way in that context, would you stop for the traffic light? So here is the context and that question came into my mind. For me, As usually, I approached to the problem from the fundamental purpose of the traffic light. It has two fundamental purpose. first is to protect people. it provides people to walk trough the road so they don't get car accidents. second is to prevent traffic jam. It allocates appropriate time to people and it makes them to go where they want efficiently. Therefore, in this approach, you can ignore the sign because it doesn't go against the fundamental purpose. and it only take your time because you could go faster if you didn't follow the traffic light. this kind of approach also explains why the ambulances can ignore the traffic signals when it has patients. However it doesn't mean I agree with "ignoring the signal". because the rule exists. I can approach to the same problem with approach from fundamental purpose of law. law are made to provide the boundary of responsability. Every decision are made by human so every one might judge differently. Therefore, Laws were made to give the strict boundary of it. if you drived over 60km/h, your fault. something like this. so laws are made to help people from feeling guilty or something. in this point of view, we can reconsider the context. what if the driver missed a person? he sured there are no people but what if he just didnt' see it. and if the accident happens, the driver must be responsible to it because he didn't follow the restriction, and it was his choice. what if he follows the traffic light. even though he didn't see a person again and get an accident, the driver will theoretically not responsible to it. because traffic light said he can go trough the crossroad, and the man who was walking by the crossroad will be responsible for it. so law should be followed in that point of view. I'm not going to answer to the problem because I don't know still. but What I want to talk about this story is the approach from the fundamental purpose is very useful and easy way to analyse the concept or problem. I have analyzed about money, game, religion and other concepts in this point of view and those are very interesting. I might write somehting about them soon because to record those is the purpose of this writing. this kind of tought process will be came out often in my writings and I believe it is pretty good way to start thinking. It has some blindpoints that sometimes fundamental purpose is very different from how it actually be used, but I think that is the place we need to change things. This sounds little contraversal but I don't mind. anyway, great! I think writing whole article in one paragraph is not a good idea. I didn't mean it but I must give some time to readers to take times and also give some time to myself while writing. I don't care, it will get better soon. awesome. bye!		</p>
