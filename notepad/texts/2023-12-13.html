			These days, I don't feel like doing something. Nothing is fun, don't feel I belong here,  and very helpless. I don't even know what kind of emotion it is. and also I cannot find any reason for it. It might because of social relationship, or burnout of my work, or phsical illness, or just the weather. It is little different with feeling lost. when I feel lost, I don't know what to do, or what kind of person I want to be. However, these days, I do know what to do, and I have goals too, but I'm just helpless and lazy. It might be I became lazy because I think I'm lazy. if there is no time to think I'm lazy, I won't be lazy too. However, this university life gives me too much freedom. I need to make some restriction and force me to have some daily routine but I'm not use to it now. I hope this gets better soon.

			there are several things that I'm concerning about these days. The first is the social relationship of course. in this case, I'm talking about relationship between friends. I'm really bad at starting new relationship. I don't know why but I believe that I need to respect all the human beings. And I don't think it is right to use other people as tool for improving my social skills. They might don't give a shit about me about those but I'm actually afraid of those. if someone who I started the relationship with is not my style, then I will try to make some distance to him, and It won't be seem good because I started the relationship, which means I'm responsible for the relationship. I know most people don't care a shit about that but something inside me make me think like that and force me to avoid artificial relationship. Also, it does make me feel bad right now too. I'm in a team that develops the application about drinking culture these days. However, what I feel right now is I want to leave the team. I like the people there but I have some difference about the direction of the project. I tought, they have a clear shape of project and specific application they wanted to make. but they don't, and we are building new application right now. that actually doesn't fit to me and honestly, I want to quit that project. However, there are something I said before, so it is not possible. May be this concern is the biggest concern right now. it makes me feel much better to write this concern down and clearly recognize why I feel bad. there are more things that makes me feel depressed, but that's usual.
